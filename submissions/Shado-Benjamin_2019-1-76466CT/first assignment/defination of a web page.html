        <h1>CONCEPTUAL DEFINITIONS OF A WEB PAGE</h1>
         <p>Conceptual definations of a good and effective web page are defined through these various criteria: Hypertext Information System, Cross Platform, Interactive, Dynamic, Distributed</p>
    </section>
         <h2 >Hypertext Information System</h2>
         
         <p>Hypertext means instead of reading a text in a right linear structure e.g One can jump around in a book from one idea to another. Multiple users can participate in a system for linking related documents called hypertext. Any word or phrase in a hypertext document has the ability to "hyperlink" to information about it that is either present in the same document or in another document. Text, graphics, and links to other web pages and files can all be found on a web page.</p>
         
         <h2 >Cross Platform</h2>
         
         <p >Information can be accessed from any computer hardware using any operating system and any display with equal ease thanks to cross-platform technology.</p>
    
    <h2 >Interactivity or Interactivity</h2>
    
    <p >In contrast to traditional television, interactivity involves the ability to communicate with the web server, such as when choosing a link to visit another web page and connecting with the publisher.</p> 
    
    <h2 >Dynamic</h2>
    
    <p >Dynamic implies that, if the content is not saved, it may change at any time, even while the page is being viewed.</p>
    
    <h2 >Distributed</h2>
    
    <p >Distributed suggests that the information is dispersed across millions of websites, each of which contributes to the space needed to publish the information. These websites are hosted by one or more web servers, which are computers.</p>
