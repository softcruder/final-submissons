            <h3>Interaction</h3>
            <p>
            
Your web site must engage with your audience, hold their attention, direct them through the stages of your
web site and finally encourage them to contact you.
Your web site is not just there for show, it is there to help you generate leads,
increase sales and grow your business so ensure your web site engages with your visitors in the correct way.

                <h3>Hypertext Information System</h3>
Hypertext is a system for linking related text documents that allows the participation of multiple users.
In a hypertext document, any word or phrase can be “hyper-linked” to information related to that word or
phrase residing in the same document or in another document.</p>

            <h3>Dynamic</h3>
            <p>
On any HTML page, all the elements present on the Data Object Model (DOM) and are rendered by the browser are called Static elements.
The elements which are invoked at the run-time and are dynamically added to the web page are called Dynamic elements.
A dynamic web site is one that changes frequently and engages the reader in various ways. It lets the visitor know that your product,
service and even brand is active and “keeping up” in the business world

            <h3>Distributed</h3>
            <p>
The main goal of a distributed system is to make it easy for users to access remote resources, and to share them with other users in a controlled manner.
Resources can be virtually anything, typical examples of resources are printers, storage facilities, data, files, web pages, and networks

            <h3>Cross Platform</h3>
            <p>
                Web applications are typically described as cross-platform because, ideally, they are accessible from any web browser:
                the browser is the platform. Web applications generally employ a client–server model, but vary widely in complexity and functionality.
