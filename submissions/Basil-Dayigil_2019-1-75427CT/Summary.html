        <h2>Hypertext Information System</h2>
        <p>Hypertext means, Instead of reading a text in a right linear structure e.g in a book, one can skip from one point
            to
            another.
            Hypertext is a system for linking related documents that allows the participation of multiple users. In a
            hypertext
            document, any word or phrase
            can be "Hyperlinked" to information related to that word or phrase residing in the same document or in another
            document.
            A web page may contain texts, Graphics and hyperLinks to other web pages and files.
        </p>
        <h2>Cross Platform</h2>

            using any display
