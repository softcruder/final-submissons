        <h2 class="subtitle">1. Hypertext Information System: </h2>
        <p id="content">
            Hypertext Information System (HIS) is a computer system that uses hypertext to present information in a
            non-linear, interactive way. Information is stored in interconnected nodes and accessed by clicking on
            links. Hypertext Information System allows for flexible and efficient access to information, making it a
            useful tool for online
            encyclopedias, knowledge management systems, and content management systems.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2 class="subtitle">2. Cross Platform: </h2>
        <p id="content">
            Cross-platform refers to the ability of software or technology to run on multiple operating systems or
            platforms without the need for modification or re-writing of code. This means that the software can be used
            on different devices and systems, such as Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, and Android, without the need for
            separate versions for each platform. Cross-platform technology enhances accessibility, compatibility, and
            interoperability between different systems, making it an important consideration for developers and
            organizations.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2 class="subtitle">3. Interactivity: </h2>
        <p id="content">
            Interactivity is the ability of a system or technology to respond to user input in real-time and offer an
            active, two-way communication experience. It allows users to engage with the system and perform actions,
            such as clicking buttons, selecting options, or entering data, and receive feedback in the form of response,
            output, or changes to the system state. Interactivity is a key characteristic of many modern technologies,
            such as video games, websites, and mobile applications, and enhances the user experience by making
            technology more engaging, dynamic, and responsive to user needs.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2 class="subtitle">4. Dynamics: </h2>
        <p id="content">
            Dynamics refers to the ability of a website or web application to change and respond to user input in
            real-time. This allows for a more interactive and engaging user experience, as the website or application
            can dynamically update its content, layout, or functionality based on user interactions. For example, a
            dynamic website can show different content based on user preferences or location, or can update a shopping
            cart in real-time as items are added or removed. Dynamics in web development is achieved through the use of
            technologies such as JavaScript, AJAX, and others, which allow for the creation of dynamic and interactive
            web experiences.

    <div>
        <h2 class="subtitle">5. Distributed: </h2>
        <p id="content">
            Distributed refers to the distribution of data, processing, or storage across multiple nodes or devices
            connected over a network. A distributed system is designed to improve scalability, reliability, and
            performance by spreading the load and responsibilities across multiple resources. This can include
            distribution of data storage across multiple servers, distribution of processing across multiple devices, or
            distribution of application logic across multiple services. Distributed systems are commonly used in web
            development to build scalable and robust applications, particularly in large-scale or mission-critical
            scenarios where high performance, reliability, and availability are required.
