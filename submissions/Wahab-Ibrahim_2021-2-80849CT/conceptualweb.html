		<span style="color:black;font-family:times new roman;font-size:20px;letter-spacing:2px;">
			The World Wide Web is a distributed hypertext information system based on the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), a standard language that describes the basic structure and layout of hypertext documents called pages (HTML pages or Web pages). HTML pages typically contain links with addresses, in the form of uniform resource locators (URLs), of other Web pages that can be stored on the user's computer or on any other Web server in the world. Users of the Web “read” HTML pages with an application called a browser.

		<span style="color:brown;font-family:times new roman;font-size:30px;"><b>Cross-platform:</b></span> 
		<span style="color:black;font-family:times new roman;font-size:20px;letter-spacing:2px;">
			Web applications are typically described as cross-platform because, ideally, they are accessible from any of various web browsers within different operating systems. Such applications generally employ a client–server system architecture, and vary widely in complexity and functionality. This wide variability significantly complicates the goal of cross-platform capability, which is routinely at odds with the goal of advanced functionality.

		<span style="color:brown;font-family:times new roman;font-size:30px;"><b>Interactive:</b></span> 
		<span style="color:black;font-family:times new roman;font-size:20px;letter-spacing:2px;">
			Put simply, an interactive website is a website that communicates and allows for interaction with users. And by interaction, we don't just mean allowing users to “click” and “scroll”. Offering users with content that is amusing, collaborative, and engaging is the essential objective of an interactive website.

		<span style="color:brown;font-family:times new roman;font-size:30px;"><b>Dynamic:</b></span> 
		<span style="color:black;font-family:times new roman;font-size:20px;letter-spacing:2px;">
			A server-side dynamic web page is a web page whose construction is controlled by an application server processing server-side scripts. In server-side scripting, parameters determine how the assembly of every new web page proceeds, and including the setting up of more client-side processing.

	<p>
		<span style="color:brown;font-family:times new roman;font-size:30px;"><b>Distributed:</b></span> 
		<span style="color:black;font-family:times new roman;font-size:20px;letter-spacing:2px;">
			The web is a distributed system of delivering linked documents over the Internet. It is called a distributed system because information can reside on different computers around the world. Yet be easily linked together using hypertext. The web uses hypertext to create links from together using hypertext.
