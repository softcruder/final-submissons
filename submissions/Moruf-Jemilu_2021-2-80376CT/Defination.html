<li><b> HYPERTEXT INFORMATION SYSTEM:</b><br/> Hypertext systems allow for non-sequential, or non-linear, reading. This is the underlying idea of
 a hypertext system. The result is a multidimensional document that can be read by following different
 paths through it. In this section we will look into the application of hypertext in computer systems, 
 mainly the World Wide Web hypertext system.The main use of hypertext is in information retrieval applications.
 The ease of linking different pieces (fragments) of information is the important aspect of hypertext information
 retrieval.The information can be of various media: it may be fragments of textual documents, structured data from
 databases, or list of terms and their definitions. Any of these, or a mixture thereof, can make up the contents
 of a hypertext document.</li> </p></div>

 <li><b>CROSS PLATFORM:</b><br/> Cross platform (also called multi-platform software, platform-agnostic software, or platform-independent software)
 is computer software that is designed to work in several computing platforms. Some cross-platform software requires a 
 separate build for each platform, but some can be directly run on any platform without special preparation, being written
 in an interpreted language or compiled to portable bytecode for which the interpreters or run-time packages are common or
 standard components of all supported platforms. For example, a cross-platform application may run on Microsoft Windows, Linux,
 and macOS. Cross-platform software may run on many platforms, or as few as two.</li></p></div>

 <li><b>INTERACTIVE:</b><br/> Interactive website is a website that communicates and allows for interaction with users. And
 by interaction, we dont just mean allowing users to <b>click</b> and <b>scroll</b>. Offering users with content that is amusing,
 collaborative, and engaging is the essential objective of an interactive website. An interactive websites design will not
 just display attractive content, it will exhibit interactive content. Content that will compel users to communicate and
 deeply engage with the website.</li></p></div>
 <div> <p align='justify'>
 <li><b>DYNAMIC</b><br/> Dynamic is a website containing data that can be mutable or changeable. It uses client-side or server
 scripting to generate mutable content. Like a static website, it also contains HTML data.Dynamic websites are those websites that
 changes the content or layout with every request to the webserver. These websites have the capability of producing different content
 for different visitors from the same source code file. There are two kinds of dynamic web pages i.e. client side scripting and server
 side scripting. The client-side web pages changes according to your activity on the web page. On the server-side, web pages are changed
 whenever a web page is loaded.</li></p></div>
 <div> <p align='justify'>
 <li><b>DISTRIBUTED</b><br/> Distributed applications (distributed apps) are applications or software that run on multiple computers within
 a network at the same time and can be stored on servers or cloud computing platforms. Unlike traditional applications that run on a single 
 system, distributed applications run on multiple systems simultaneously.</li></p></div>
