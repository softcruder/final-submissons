 	</ul>
 	<ul>
 		<li align="left">Cross Platform</li>

 	</ul>
 	
 	<h2 align="center">Hypertext Information System</h2>
 	
 	<p style="text-align: left;">Hypertext means instead of reading a text in a right linear structure e.g In a book,one can skip from point to another.Hypertext is a system for linking related documents that allows that allows the participation of multiple users.In a hypertext document,any word or phrase can be "hyperlinked" to information related to that word or phrase residing in the same document or in another document.A web page may contain texts,graphics,and hyperlinks to other web pages and files.</p>
 	
 	<h2 align="center">Cross Platform</h2>
 	
 	<p style="text-align: left;">Cross platform is the ability to access information equally well from any computer hardware running any operating system using any display.Then,after the application running on the server,we can access the web page via browser.So,to the "cross-platform",it means the server side,instead of the client side(access the web page via browser)</p>

<h2 align="center">Interactivity or Interactivity</h2>

<p style="text-align: left;">Interactivity is the capability to talk to the web server unlike the traditional television i.e The ability to select a link and jump to another web page and connect with the publisher.Interactive features that are embedded on websites that offer an exchange of information either between communication technology and users or in between users using technology.This type of interactivity evolves with new developments of websites interfaces.</p> 

<h2 align="center">Dynamic</h2>

<p style="text-align: left;">Dynamic implies that the content can change anytime even when the page is being viewed if not saved.A dynamic web page is a web page that displays different content each time it's viewed.For example,the page may change with the time of day,the user that accesses webpage,or the type of user interaction.There are two types of dynamic web pages </p>

<h2 align="center">Distributed</h2>

<p style="text-align: left;">Distributed implies that information provided is shared globally across millions of websites,each of which contributes the space for the information it publishes.These sites reside on one or more computers referred to as web servers.</p>
