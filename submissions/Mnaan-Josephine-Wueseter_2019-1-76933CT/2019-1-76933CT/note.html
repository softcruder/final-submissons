            <strong>Hypertext information system:</strong> in hypertext definition 
            system, instead of reading  a text in rigid linear 
            structure. One can skip or jump from one document to 
            another(that is navigate, go back and front) simply by clicking on hot spots.

            <strong>Interactive: </strong> It is the capability to talk back to the web server
            unlike traditional TV, that is ability to select a link, jump to another web page, 
            and communicate with the publisher.

            <strong>Dynamic: </strong>This implies that the content can change any time even when 
            a page is being viewed if not saved.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strong>Distributed: </strong>Distributed implies that the information provided
            is shared globally across millions of website. Each of which 
            contributes the space for the information it publishes. These sites reside on one or more computers
            referred to as web servers.
