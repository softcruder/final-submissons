 	<h2 align="left">Hypertext Information System</h2>
 	
 	<p style="text-align: left;">Hypertext means instead of reading a text in a right linear structure 
        e.g In a book,one can skip from one point to another. Hypertext is a system for linking related documents 
        that allows the participation of multiple users. <br>
        In a hypertext document,any word or phrase 
        can be "hyperlinked" to information related to that word or phrase residing in the same document or 
        in another document.A web page may contain texts,graphics,and hyperlinks to other web pages and files.</p>
 	
 	<h2 align="left">Cross Platform</h2>
 	
 	<p style="text-align: left;">Cross platform is the ability to access information equally well from any computer 
        hardware running any operating system using any display.</p>

<h2 align="left">Interactivity</h2>

<p style="text-align: left;">Interactivity is the capability to talk to the web server unlike the traditional television 
    i.e The ability to select a link and jump to another web page and connect with the publisher.</p> 

<h2 align="left">Dynamic</h2>

<p style="text-align: left;">Dynamic implies that the content can change anytime even when the page is being viewed if not saved.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Distributed implies that information provided is shared globally across millions of 
    websites,each of which contributes the space for the information it publishes.These sites reside on one or more computers referred to as web servers.</p>
