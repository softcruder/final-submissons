  <h1>Conceptual Definition of the Web</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>Hypertext:</strong> The web is based on the concept of hypertext, which is text that contains links to other documents or resources. These links allow users to easily navigate between different pages and access information from multiple sources.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Hypermedia:</strong> In addition to hypertext, the web also uses hypermedia, which is media (such as images, videos, audio, etc.) that contains links to other documents or resources. This allows users to access multimedia content and interact with it in a similar way to hypertext.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Universal Resource Identifiers (URIs):</strong> The web uses URIs to identify and locate resources on the internet. These unique identifiers allow users to easily access and share resources, and enable the web to function as a decentralized, distributed network.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP):</strong> The web uses HTTPS to secure communicationover a computer network and it is widely used on the internet. It is also the combination of the hypertext transfer protocol with the secure socket layer.
    <p>
      <strong>File Transfer Protocol (FTP):</strong> The web uses the file transfer 
      proocol as a standard communication protocol for transfer of computer files
       from a server to a client on a computer network. its also a network protocol for transmittig files between computers over transmission protocols (TCPs/IPs)connections. FTP is considered an application layer protocol.
